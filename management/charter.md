# Team Integration System
## Discovery Team Charter


#### Team Purpose

Learn more about the [goal of TIS](https://github.com/18F/tis-discovery/blob/master/goal.md) and the [problem we are trying to solve](https://github.com/18F/tis-discovery/blob/master/problem.md).

We are conducting a Team Integration System discovery that will consist of market research, professional services procurements, and product strategy to determine the viability of a particular approach to an MVP.  After we finish the research and define a minimum viable product, we will present to the Incubator PAB.  Our recommendations will be part of their decision on whether to proceed with the next level of funding.

#### Operations

**Staffing**: [Discovery staffing issue](https://github.com/18F/staffing-and-resources/issues/347)
**Timeline**: [Float project timeline](https://18f.float.com/?project=P%26P+%2F+OPP+%2F+Team+Integration+System)
**Scope**: [Discovery Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCedRaHZ4ycI_fw3ns906euvfoyBqFzgJH40e9948w4/edit)

#### Collaboration

* We’ll work in the open as much as possible, within TTS and with external partners.

* We’ll constantly look for new ways to collaborate internally and with team partners, and amend this charter and related references regularly with new forms of adopted collaboration.

* We’ll collaborate with other Incubator efforts whenever possible.

#### Governance

* We’ll adopt and live by this **Team Charter** for the life of the discovery project.  We’ll amend the strategy through team consensus.  The Business Owner, representing the host organization, will be a tie breaker if we can’t reach consensus.

* We’ll adopt and follow a [Discovery Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCedRaHZ4ycI_fw3ns906euvfoyBqFzgJH40e9948w4/edit) for the life of the discovery project.  We’ll amend the strategy through team consensus.  The Portfolio Owner, representing the client, will be a tie breaker if we can’t reach consensus.

* Each of us will lead one track of research, and we’ll collaborate closely on deliverables and communication.

#### Partnerships

* We’ll work closely with the TTS Operations and Agreements teams to process any acquisitions with OPP efficiently and document the process and agreement language

* We’ll work closely with the TTS security team to plan security features into the MVP recommendations

* We’ll figure out with TTS Acquisitions the best way to integrate or avoid competing with their procurement vision and services

* We’ll work closely with FAS/TTS COs, OGC, and the GSA CIO to help process any pilot acquisition agreements efficiently

* We’ll form working partnerships with FAS/TTS acquisition partners, vendors, independent contractors, and agency management needing skilled professionals to temporarily augment their operational capacity
