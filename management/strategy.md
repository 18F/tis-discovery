# Team Integration System
## Discovery Strategy


### Overview

This document outlines the general discovery strategy employed for the Team Integration System Incubator project.  It is a living document and edited over time by discovery team members and relevant stakeholders.  See the [Discovery Team Charter](https://github.com/18F/tis-discovery/blob/master/management/charter.md) on procedures for altering this Discovery Strategy (officially).

#### Purpose

The goal of the Team Integration System (TIS) is to help redefine the government labor market and transform how the government builds and manages teams to achieve agency missions.

To achieve this goal, we are researching and potentially building a talent marketplace and online matchmaking platform. TIS is envisioned to help government managers match their budgeted project work with hybrid teams of available, skilled, and interested employees and contractors. By providing an online tool for finding, connecting with, and deploying skilled professionals, managers should be able to assemble effective project teams oriented around specific problems efficiently. The system should automatically generate and finalize approved boilerplate for any contracts with combinations of vendors and HR efficiently.

This project consists of product discovery to determine the viability of particular approaches, researching the existing federal workforce landscape and regulatory environment, and mapping the professional services acquisition process across vehicles.

See the [Discovery MOU](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwxvcCvwvTB3QUZXSTZyNzdDNkE/view) for more details.

#### Tracks

The TIS discovery project is divided into three tracks; **Research**, **Acquisition**, and **Product**.

1. Perform market related research with agency management, vendors and contractors, integration partners, and include perspectives from literature and other materials to produce a clear and confident market research report to guide the product forward, if approved.

2. Plan, execute, monitor, and report on status of contractor or team acquisitions.  Use these pilot acquisitions to map and engineer processes and generate reusable artifacts and templates for further automation.

3. Submit suggestions for core platform architecture and operational practices, and prioritize MVP features for agency management, vendors, contractors, and acquisition professionals.  Possibly provide mockups of feature interfaces or integrations.

#### Team

This discovery project is managed through collaborative standards that live in the [Discovery Team Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JdgPMguZQeSJuh4n9oabUT1xFq67g3fR6VHVgFf_0Yo/edit).  The team charter outlines all operational guidelines for the team, and defines governance procedures for the discovery strategy.

#### Deliverables

**Market Landscape Report** that highlights agency demand, likely vendor and contractor participation, acquisition recommendations, and potentially viable business models

At least one successful **pilot acquisition** of a contractor or team

**Repeatable acquisition strategies** with **reusable template artifacts**

**Core platform** recommendations

**Product feature priorities** for all participants in team building process


### Research

The most outwardly focused track in the discovery project is the market research component.  We’ll conduct research across a diverse pool of potential agency partners, vendors and contractors, and potential integration partners.  We’ll also ensure perspectives from existing literature and materials will be represented in a final Market Landscape Report.

#### Agency Management

**MOU Directive**: Conduct interviews and/or surveys with agency partners who must build teams within the government, such as CIOs, mission executives, and portfolio/program managers.

#### Market Landscape Report

**MOU Directive**: Synthesize data and insights gathered into a market landscape report, that summarizes agency demand, explores likely vendor participation across the size classifications, and offers acquisition recommendations based on research findings.

### Acquisition

The Team Integration System is starting down the path of integrating with professional services acquisitions before HR hiring functions due to the volume of professional services usage, the reduced focus on government hiring at the moment, and the opportunity to form meaningful public / private sector partnerships.  In order to test integrations that could serve our agency partners we need to perform actual acquisitions.  These pilot acquisitions will allow us to execute, evaluate, and tweak the process for continuous improvement, and measure the feasibility of moving ahead with the MVP.

### Product

The goal of the Team Integration System is to serve as a technology platform for matching, deploying, and managing hybrid employee / contractor cross-functional teams over time.  The product track is focused on initial planning for basic platform functionality and the MVP features it will offer various participants of the team building process.
