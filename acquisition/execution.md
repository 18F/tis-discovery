# Team Integration System
## Acquisition Execution


**MOU Directive**: **Perform one or more professional services acquisitions and develop a process map that can guide automation.**

We will work with willing integration partners identified in this document to execute one or more professional services contracts for clients using various acquisition strategies identified above.

It is important to note TIS is not in the business of acquisition, but is envisioned to provide a unified experience and integration of agency management needs and acquisition partners capabilities into an efficient process for everyone involved.  We are attempting to build a marketplace and a matchmaking platform.

### Finding Procurements

Weâ€™ll pursue internal acquisition projects for OPP portfolios and programs, who have been very supportive.  We will gauge interest from external agency management and prioritize potential pilot candidates but will not execute external contracts until the next phase of the Team Integration System, unless we can not find a suitable candidate internally, which is highly unlikely.

### Contracting / Brokering

We need efficient processes in place to bridge agency management needing contractors, vendors and contractors who could provide the needed services, and our integration partners who would need to orchestrate the process.  We will attempt to build the glue that keeps the process running efficiently, but will not actually be the service provider.

Each acquisition strategy will have special requirements when it comes to contracting and integration process.  What can be shared between integration partners should be shared.

### Operational Considerations

In order to build a system to automate the process for everyone involved in the professional services contracting process, we will need transparency into the process and materials used so we can start to understand similarities and differences, and develop automation strategies.  We will not work with a potential integration partner unless we have transparency into the process, and can help tune it over time.

To accomplish this transparency the discovery team members will need to work with our FAS/TTS integration partners and legal to understand what can be public, what should be private, and what is the bare minimum needed to meet procurement sensitivity requirements.
