# Team Integration System
## Acquisition Retrospectives


**MOU Directive**: **Evaluate the results of completed professional services acquisitions and document what went well, what did not go well, how we can improve, and alter any existing process maps.**

We will conduct final retrospectives on all completed acquisitions.  These retros will help us track what is successful, what needs improvement, and ideas on how we can change to better meet agency, vendor, contractor, and acquisition professional needs over time.  Each retro will lead to the re-evaluation of the appropriate acquisition strategy process map and related documentation.

### Evaluation

At the conclusion of the contract award period we will conduct a final evaluation of the same variety used in the Post Award Management Evaluation section of this document.  This evaluation will highlight the successes, failures, improvements needed, and other recommendations for iteratively improving next time around.

### Timeline

Acquisition retrospectives only happen upon the closing or cancellation of an executed acquisition through an integration partner for our pilot agency partners.

### Success

A successful acquisition is measured by happy agency management, vendors, contractors, integration partners, and acquisition professionals.  Ultimately the tasks that the agency management needed handled are satisfactorily completed

### Improvement

All of the discovery teams brokered acquisitions will have room for improvement.  We need to honestly evaluate what went wrong, who did not have an easy or efficient experience, if it was something we could have prevented, and any other issues that caused frustration to various parties involved.

### Feedback Loops

In order to continuously improve, evaluations from discovery team acquisition retros should be expediently integrated into our acquisition process going forward.  Process maps and related documentation should be updated with lessons learned from previous acquisitions before starting any new ones with the same acquisition strategies.
