# Team Integration System
## Acquisition Process Engineering


**MOU Directive**: **Compile documentation and boilerplate legal templates for potential acquisition strategies employing professional services acquisitions, potential and existing collaborators, and legal limitations.**

We will seek to document, boilerplate, template, and automate (in concept) much of the professional service acquisition process, through technology and modern productivity practices.  We will work with our agency partners and integration partners to understand how and why the process works they way it does, what is really needed, and ideas about how to change the process to fit the needs of the various parties.

### Process Mapping

For each acquisition strategy we employ in the discovery project, we will create a process map that can guide subsequent execution. This process allows us to better understand the automation possibilities, limitations, and bottlenecks, and can help us tune the process with our integration partners over time.  Process maps should be revisited and potentially updated after acquisition retros.

### Documentation / Diagrams

Documentation or diagrams might be created that highlight aspects of the acquisition or team building process to help either guide internal development of acquisition strategies or external communication of existing acquisition strategies.

### Templates

A big factor in our ability to improve the efficiency of the contracting process through automation is the ability to template pre-approved contracting and agreement language.  The discovery project will build a collection of templates for acquisition strategies used to help guide the platform automation in the next phase of the project, if approved.

### Collaboration

The processes by which the discovery team collaborate with agency partners, vendors, contractors, integration partners, and acquisition professionals will need to be defined and improved over time.  We need to find ways in this process of achieving efficiency through effective collaboration between related parties.

### Legal Limitations

There will be regulatory obstacles we will want to avoid, and some we wish to change.  The discovery project will identify potential problem areas that cause inefficiencies in the contracting process and strategize ways around them or detail recommendations for needed regulatory change.
