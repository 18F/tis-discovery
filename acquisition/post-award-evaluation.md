## Acquisition Post Award Evaluation


**MOU Directive**: **Evaluate and provide advice on post award management of professional services contractors.**

We will evaluate and monitor the post award activities of any executed professional services acquisition contracts to analyze the quality of service and adjustments that should be made in the process in the future.  We will work with agency partners, vendors, contractors, integration providers, and acquisition professionals to understand how we can improve the quality of service delivery during the period of performance of the service contracts.

### Evaluation

During the contract award period we will be evaluating the post award management process to look successful practices or areas of improvement.  The evaluation results will feed into the process engineering priorities.

### Advice

During the contract award period we may be asked to give or volunteer advice on how to integrate contractors more effectively within the confines of personal services regulation.  We might also share lessons between acquisitions to encourage shared learning or standardization of practices if that makes sense.

### Reporting

During the contract award period we will generate weekly reports that outline the status of the acquisitions being executed, any successful practices or areas needing improvement, calls for feedback, and recommendations for how we could iteratively improve over time.
