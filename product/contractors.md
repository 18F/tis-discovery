## Contractor Product Features


**MOU Directive**: **Explore developing prototype features for contractors, such as managing their own profile.**

Weâ€™ll draft a backlog of product features for contractors based on market research, acquisition processing, and technological considerations, and prioritize an MVP set of features necessary for initial launch of an online platform that serves the contractor management and evaluation processes.

### Profiles

Contractors will need some form of profile to update their own capabilities and interests over time to be accurately matched to government project work.  We need to determine what is important for an contractor profile.

### Contact

Contractors should have a way to initiate and respond to contact from agency managers and acquisition professionals managing their contractor agreements.  We need to determine what this process would look like for contractors.
