## Acquisition Professional Product Features


**MOU Directive**: **Explore developing prototype features for acquisition professionals, such as registering and creating a profile, and accepting, collecting, submitting, and reporting on the status of orders (professional services contracts).**

Weâ€™ll draft a backlog of product features for acquisition professionals based on market research, acquisition processing, and technological considerations, and prioritize an MVP set of features necessary for initial launch of an online platform that serves the internal acquisition process.

### Profiles

Acquisition professionals will need some form of profile to manage orders and acquisition agreements over time.  We need to determine what is important for an acquisition professional profile.

### Search

Acquisition professionals need a way to search for projects, vendors, and orders.  What kind of search would make the most sense for an MVP?

### Contact

Acquisition professionals need a way to initiate contact with vendors and contractors or agency managers whom they are servicing their contractor agreements.  We need to determine what this process would look like.

### Orders

Acquisition professionals need a way to assign themselves to orders, generate paperwork, submit, and manage contract over time.  We need to think about what is most valuable in an MVP.
