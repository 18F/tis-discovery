# Team Integration System
## Product Platform


**MOU Directive**: **Explore developing a minimum viable online marketplace for professional services contractors using an actively supported open source CMS or web framework, with features that focus on various profiles, granular search, basic order workflow, and template automation.**

We will recommend core components of the platform architecture going forward.  This includes any domains in which the system would live, hosting strategy, any core technologies that should be considered and why, API and web interface strategy, and core functions, such as authentication, administration, and security.

These recommendations are designed to speed execution in the next phase of the project, should it be approved.

### Domains

While not necessary in the discovery project, the Team Integration System will need to live at a public web address.  The discovery team will compile a list of domains that we wish TIS to manage in the list below.

### Hosting

All prototypes and early platforms will be hosted on Cloud.gov in an Incubator managed prototyping account (still to be worked out).  If we are approved for product development we will work to acquire the correct Cloud.gov production hosting account based on our estimated FISMA level (determined with security).

### API / Web Interfaces

As part of the product planning we should start thinking about the core API / Interface architecture of the platform.

_Potential questions:_

* What APIs do we offer, to whom?
* Do we have a monolithic interface for all users, or separate focused interfaces for different types of users?
* Do we build with mobile first in mind, or for a larger productivity screen (laptop)?

### Authentication

We need to determine if this can be integrated with shared login providers like Login.gov from the very beginning to prevent migration headaches later on.  An authentication strategy will help the discovery team set realistic timelines for integrating and registering users.

### Administration

The TIS will handle sensitive information about contractors and vendors and about ordering habits and acquisition professionals assignments.  It will be very important to carefully consider who manages what process and the levels of access.  We will need to work closely with FAS/TTS acquisition partners, legal, and security throughout the life of the project to ensure that administration of the platform is designed with efficiency, security, and reliability in mind.
Security

The discovery team should seek the security teams advice in generating platform recommendations since we will need to keep security of information a major focus.  Keeping security people engaged will also allow us to plan and prepare more effectively for ATO of the MVP platform during product development, if approved.
