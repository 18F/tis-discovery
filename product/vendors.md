## Vendor Product Features


**MOU Directive**: **Explore developing prototype features for vendors, such as registering and creating a profile, and managing sub accounts for contractors.**

We will draft a backlog of product features for vendors based on market research, acquisition processing, and technological considerations, and prioritize an MVP set of features necessary for initial launch of an online platform that serves vendors in the professional services acquisition and contractor management processes.

### Profiles

Vendors will need some form of profile to track orders and manage contractors over time.  We need to determine what is important for an vendor profile.

### Search

Vendors could possibly have a way to search for agency project needs.  This search could accept project criteria and return matched projects and vendor contractors.  Would this be important, and if so, what kind of search would make the most sense for an MVP?

### Contact

Vendors should have a way to initiate and respond to contact from agency managers and acquisition professionals managing their contractor agreements.  We need to determine what this process would look like for vendors.

### Sub Accounts

Vendors need a way to add and manage contractors that can be deployed on government projects over time.  We need to think about how this process would work.
