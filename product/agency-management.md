## Agency Management


**MOU Directive**: **Explore developing prototype features for agency managers, such as registering and creating a profile, searching profiles, initiating contact with vendors and contractors, and submitting orders for processing by acquisition professionals.**

We will draft a backlog of product features for agency management based on market research, acquisition processing, and technological considerations, and prioritize an MVP set of features necessary for initial launch of an online platform that serves the agency team building process.

### Profiles

Agency managers will need some form of profile to track orders and funding over time.  We need to determine what is important for an agency management profile.

### Search

Agency managers need a way to search for contractors for their projects.  This search could accept project criteria and return matched contractors or groups of contractors.  What kind of search would make the most sense for an MVP?

### Contact

Agency managers need a way to initiate contact with vendors and contractors or acquisition professionals managing their contractor agreements.  We need to determine what this process would look like.

### Orders

An order groups a project need with one or more contractors and initiates an agreement build.  We need to think about how this process would work transparently under the hood, so orders for skilled professionals could be efficiently processed.
