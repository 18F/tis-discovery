Interview request: challenges in forming teams of technologists

### Message

Hello {agency executive},

I’m {first researcher name} a researcher at 18F (https://www.18f.gov), part of the General Services Administration. My colleagues {second 18F staff} and {third 18f staff}, and I are researching the challenges agencies face when forming project teams of federal and contractor staff. We’re specifically interested in your experience forming and managing technical teams composed of both feds and contractors. Learning more about this space and your challenges will help us work to lower hurdles, improve working relationships, and shipping stronger products.

**Would you, or a member of your team, spare 50 minutes over the next 2 weeks to speak with us?** To make it as easy as possible, we can conduct the interview remotely using Google Hangouts (if that works for you), or a phone call. Whichever you prefer.

We appreciate you taking the time to review our request and we hope to speak with you soon.

Thank you,
{first researcher name}

Hello {integration partner},

I’m {first researcher name} a researcher at 18F (https://www.18f.gov), part of the General Services Administration.  My colleagues {second 18F staff} and {third 18f staff}, and I are researching how professional services contractors are delivered to agency partners, as well as the challenges and limitations.  We are exploring the viability of a marketplace for agency managers to efficiently build quality technical teams of both federal employees and contractors. Such a platform could integrate your service offerings. We're interested in your thoughts!
