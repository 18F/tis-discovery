Interview request: challenges in forming teams of technologists

### Message

Hello {agency executive},

I’m {first researcher name} a researcher at 18F (https://www.18f.gov), part of the General Services Administration. My colleagues {second 18F staff} and {third 18f staff}, and I are working to better understand the challenges agencies face when forming project teams of federal and contractor staff. We’re specifically interested in your experience forming teams of _technologists_, and managing teams composed of both feds and contractors. Learning more about this space and your challenges will help us work to lower hurdles and improve the experience.

**Can you, or a member of your team, spare 50 minutes over the next 2 weeks to speak with us?** To make it as easy as possible, we can conduct the interview remotely using Google Hangouts (if that works for you), or a phone call. Whichever you prefer.

We appreciate you taking the time to review our request and we hope to speak with you soon.

Thank you,
{first researcher name}

Hello {integration partner},

I’m {first researcher name} a researcher at 18F (https://www.18f.gov), part of the General Services Administration.  My colleagues {second 18F staff} and {third 18f staff}, and I are working to better understand the processes and policies that allow you to deliver professional services contractors to agency partners, as well as the challenges and limitations.  We are researching the possibility of providing a technology marketplace for agency managers to efficiently build quality teams, that could potentially integrate your service offerings, allowing us to form a mutually beneficial partnership.

Hello {known Agile BPA vendor POC name},

I’m {first researcher name} a researcher at 18F (https://www.18f.gov). My colleagues {second 18F staff} and {third 18f staff} (cc'd), and I are working to better understand the challenges you face when responding to govt RFPs for technologist-based professional services (people not products). We'd also like to hear your thoughts on a few marketplace ideas we're batting around. All/any thoughts and feedback you're willing to offer will be kept in confidence, and any notes we take will not be attributed to you.
