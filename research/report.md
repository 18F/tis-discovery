# Team Integration System
## Market Landscape Report


**MOU Directive**: **Synthesize data and insights gathered into a market landscape report, that summarizes agency demand, explores likely vendor participation across the size classifications, and offers acquisition recommendations based on research findings.**

The final deliverable that is derived from the research activities is a market landscape report.  This report serves as a guide for product evaluation and business strategy in the next phase of the Team Integration System evolution, if approved.

This report will be presented to the OPP Assistant Commissioner and the Incubator Governance Council in the request for continued funding.

### Agency Demand

One of the most important questions we need to be asking is if there is demand for such a service in the federal government.

_Some questions to answer:_

* Would agencies purchase services through the platform?
* What types of agencies and programs need this type of service most often?
* How much time do agency partners expect contractor selection, contracting, and onboarding to take today, and what would be a good target for success?
* How would we collaborate and provide customer service as we are growing?
* What features would agency partners recommend for an MVP?

### Vendor / Contractor Participation

Since the TIS is a database of people (mostly contractors) we need to get their perspective on how they would most want to participate, and if they have glaring concerns that would prevent participation.

_Some questions to answer:_

* Would vendors and contractors be willing to provide services through the platform?
* What is the distribution of vendors that support this type of service?
* How would vendors and contractors like to be engaged throughout the process?
* What features would vendors and contractors recommend for an MVP?

### Acquisition Recommendations

We need to clearly outline potential acquisition strategies for providing team building capabilities through an online marketplace.  We ideally should have at least two integration partners willing to work with us during the next phase of execution.

The government has a lot of regulation and legacy processes and technology that could slow or potentially prevent the establishment of a service like the Team Integration System.  It is important we recognize systemic issues and obstacles and present innovative plans to move around them.  If we hit a brick wall and can not find an easy path around obstacles, this also needs to be noted prominently.

_Some questions to answer:_

* Would potential acquisition partners be willing to integrate longer term to provide a unified staffing service?
* Would acquisition professionals be willing to use and contribute to it over time?
* How would we collaborate and provide customer service as we are growing?
* What features would integration partners and acquisition professionals recommend for an MVP?

### Business Models

One of the major goals of this project since the beginning has been to make it cost recoverable as soon as possible, so it can grow or shrink according to market demand and our ability to provide efficient service.  In order to make this a reality we need to consider our regulatory and financial environment, and craft potential strategies that can be employed to financially support the service over time.

_Some questions to answer:_

* What are the means of accepting payment from our partners?
* How long does the process take to accept money from partners for services?
* Can service funding be split from service ordering and delivery (metro card approach)?
* How would we price ordering or participation on the TIS?
* How can we minimize the delay from project needs to contractor deployment while pursuing a strategy of on-demand pricing?
