# Team Integration System
## Integration Partner Research


**MOU Directive**: **Conduct interviews and/or surveys with acquisition professionals who manage professional services contracts in government and potentially industry.**

The discovery project will approach various potential integration partners that provide professional services acquisitions capabilities to federal government managers.  It is important that we include multiple integration partners in our research to help understand the range of possibilities in meeting government temporary staffing needs.

_Potential questions we could ask include:_

* Is this a type of service that potential integration partners would want to provide capabilities through?
* What are the most important considerations for acquiring temporary help?
* What kind of issues do acquisitions professionals face in staffing effective teams?
* What kinds of professions are most in-demand from agency users of professional services acquisitions?
* Do certain agencies have special policy restrictions or exemptions that would help or hurt a project like TIS?
* What is the integration partner pricing model?
* How could we most effectively integrate?
* etc...

### FAS Professional Services Category Division (PSC)

FAS PSC and Region 10 maintain the Professional Services Schedule which is the central vehicle maintained by FAS to acquire professional services in the federal government.  Using the schedules we can eliminate some of the acquisition hassle by utilizing FAR section 8.4 guidelines.  We need to figure out the most efficient means of brokering contracts to FAS PSC for execution through Region 10.

### FAS Information Technology Category Division (ITC)

FAS ITC maintains the GSA GWACs portfolio, which often have very efficient terms of use compared to traditional acquisition vehicles due to the focus on helping disadvantaged businesses.  We need to figure out the most efficient means of brokering contracts to FAS ITC for execution through a CO we most likely have to provide.  NCR, PSC, or TTS Acquisitions might be able to provide this service.

### FAS National Capital Region (NCR)

FAS NCR maintains one or more BPAs to acquire independent contractors through staffing firms that can efficiently hire or sub-contract and manage temporary contractor talent based on agency demand and contractor availability and interest.  Using this method we could engage independent contractors not registered with SAM.  We need to figure out the most efficient means of brokering contracts to FAS NCR for execution.

### New Integration Partnersâ€¦

We should be open to new integration partners not yet considered to pursue a well rounded collection of executable capabilities.
