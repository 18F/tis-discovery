# Team Integration System
## Integration Partner Research


**MOU Directive**: **Conduct interviews and/or surveys with acquisition professionals who manage professional services contracts in government and potentially industry.**

The discovery project will approach various potential integration partners that provide professional services acquisitions capabilities to federal government managers.  It is important that we include multiple integration partners in our research to help understand the range of possibilities in meeting government temporary staffing needs.

See the [integration partner research protocols](https://github.com/18F/tis-discovery/blob/master/research/protocols/integration-partner.md) for more information about the integration partner interview process.

See the [recruiting email templates](https://github.com/18F/tis-discovery/blob/master/research/templates/recruiting-email.md) for an introductory interview request for potential integration partners.

### TTS Acquisitions

We will meet with representatives from the TTS Acquisitions division that maintain various tools, such as AgileBPA and the MicroPurchase platform, and have suggested potentially integrating with and purchasing from existing labor marketplaces in the private sector.

According to TTS Acquisitions we could potentially purchase services through them using FAR Part 12, using a similar process as the TTS Bug Bounty.

### FAS Professional Services Category Division (PSC)

We will meet with representatives from FAS PSC and Region 10, which maintains the Professional Services Schedule which is the central vehicle maintained by FAS to acquire professional services in the federal government.  

Using the schedules we can eliminate some of the acquisition hassle by utilizing FAR section 8.4 guidelines.

### FAS Information Technology Category Division (ITC)

We will meet with representatives from FAS ITC, which maintains the GSA GWACs portfolio, that often have very efficient terms of use compared to traditional acquisition vehicles due to the focus on helping disadvantaged businesses.

### FAS National Capital Region (NCR)

We will meet with representatives from FAS NCR, which maintains one or more BPAs to acquire independent contractors through staffing firms that can efficiently hire or sub-contract and manage temporary contractor talent based on agency demand and contractor availability and interest.  

Using this method we could engage independent contractors not registered with SAM.

### New Integration Partnersâ€¦

We should be open to new integration partners not yet considered to pursue a well rounded collection of executable capabilities.
