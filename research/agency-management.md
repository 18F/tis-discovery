# Team Integration System
## Agency Management Research


**MOU Directive**: **Conduct interviews and/or surveys with agency partners who must build teams within the government, such as CIOs, mission executives, and portfolio/program managers.**

We will approach various potential agency partners that have a probable need of building cross-functional teams of a temporary nature.  It is important that we get a representative sample of small to large agencies to help understand a more complete agency landscape.

_Potential questions we could ask include:_

* Is this a type of service the agency would use and pay for?
* What are the most important considerations for bringing in temporary help?
* What kind of issues do agencies face in building effective teams?
* What kinds of professions are potentially most valuable to the agency?
* Does the agency have special policy restrictions or exemptions?
* etc...

### Agency Executives

We should attempt to meet with as many executives, including CIOs and CTOs of potential partner agencies, as possible given the discovery timeline and budget to understand larger agency staffing/contracting priorities.

Since portfolio and division managers will have a good feel for the needs represented in potential agency partners mission divisions they should be consulted as much as possible to dig into potential in-demand service areas.

### Agency Program / Project Managers

Program and Project managers have the most detailed knowledge of project needs and are often in charge of the hiring and contracting for their projects.
