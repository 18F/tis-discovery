# Team Integration System
## Vendor Research


**MOU Directive**: **Conduct interviews and/or surveys with an equal distribution of micro, small, medium, and large professional services vendors.**

Weâ€™ll approach various vendors and contractors that do or could provide temporary professional services help to the federal government.  All vendors and independent contractors should be included from diverse specialities through open public solicitation and filtered based on fair transparent evaluation criteria to get a representative sample for research purposes.

See the [vendor research protocols](https://github.com/18F/tis-discovery/blob/master/research/protocols/vendors.md) for more information about the vendor interview process.

See the [independent contractor research protocols](https://github.com/18F/tis-discovery/blob/master/research/protocols/independent-contractors.md) for more information about the independent contractor interview process.

See the [recruiting email templates](https://github.com/18F/tis-discovery/blob/master/research/templates/recruiting-email.md) for an introductory interview request for various types of agency management.
