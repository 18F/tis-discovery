# Team Integration System
## Vendor Research


**MOU Directive**: **Conduct interviews and/or surveys with an equal distribution of micro, small, medium, and large professional services vendors.**

Weâ€™ll approach various vendors and contractors that do or could provide temporary professional services help to the federal government.  All vendors and independent contractors should be included from diverse specialities through open public solicitation and filtered based on fair transparent evaluation criteria to get a representative sample for research purposes.

_Potential questions we could ask include:_

* Is this a type of service the contractors and/or vendors would use and provide services through?
* What are the most important considerations for providing temporary help?
* What kind of issues do contractors and vendors face in staffing effective teams?
* What kinds of professions are potentially most in demand for the vendor or contractor?
* etc...

### Independent Contractors

The TIS discovery team will attempt to meet with as many independent contractors as possible given the discovery timeline and budget to understand their desire or resistance to providing services to the federal government through an online marketplace.

### Small Businesses

Small businesses (fewer than 50 employees) are disadvantaged in the current government professional services marketplace.  We want to ensure we have equal representation of this vendor class to capture the perspective of small consultancies and staffing firms, and early startups.

### Midsize Businesses

Midsize businesses (fewer than 250 employees) are more likely to participate in the current government professional services marketplace.  We want to ensure we have equal representation of this vendor class to capture the perspective of larger consultancies and staffing firms, and maturing startups.

### Large Businesses

Large businesses (250 or more employees) are most likely to participate in the current government professional services marketplace and win the most contracts through prime vendor arrangements.  We want to ensure we have equal representation of this vendor class to capture the perspective of large consultancies, major integration and staffing firms, and other mature enterprises.
