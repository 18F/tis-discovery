**How do agencies think about and approach acquiring technologists (people)?**

## Recruitment and targeting

**Goal: interview no less than 5 top spending dept/agency/bureau CIOs**

## Interview/conversation guide

*A loosely structured and general guide with topical areas and conversation prompts related to the framing questions above. The conversation itself will not follow these questions exactly.* 

### Intro

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.

We are working to better understand the challenges agencies face when forming project teams of federal and contractor staff. We’re specifically interested in your experience forming teams of technologists, and managing teams composed of both feds and contractors. Learning more about this space and your challenges will help us work to lower hurdles and improve the experience.

You don’t have to answer any question you don’t want to answer and we can stop at any point. 

Any questions or concerns before we begin?

### Warm up

Please tell us a little about your role and exposure to the our area of interest

### Questions 
*more specific than framing questions, and aligned with framing questions*

* How do you go about building a technology-focused team? Project based, staffing an office, doesn’t matter. 
* What are some of your biggest pain-points? What worries you? 
* What expertise, internal processes or policies, and/or statutes/regs/memos help your efforts? Which ones hurt your efforts
* Does your approach and actions change depending on which line of the SAT you’re on? 
* If you were visited by the make-my-job-easier genie, what would your three wishes be? 

### Wrap up

* Any last thoughts? Anything we should have asked about but did not? 
* Who else might we talk to? Any colleagues? Anyone in particular who knows a lot about this space or has a different perspective? **try to get a name before getting off the call**
* Thanks so much! This has been really helpful. Please feel free to reach out if you think of anything else.
