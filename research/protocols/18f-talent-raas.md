# **Research protocol: 18F Recruitment as a Service, and Hiring as a Service Pilots**
 
## Framing questions
 
What do we want to learn? *1-3 broad questions, not necessarily what we’ll ask in interviews.*
 
1. What need prompted the RaaS/HaaS pilot?  
2. What were the successes and failures of the RaaS/HaaS pilot; what did we learn? 
3. Why did we stop? 
4. What would the RaaS/HaaS pilot team have done differently? 
 
## Recruitment and targeting
 
Goal: interview, at minimum, the lead on the 18F RaaS pilot
 
## Interview/conversation guide
 
*A loosely structured and general guide with topical areas and conversation prompts related to the framing questions above. The conversation itself will not follow these questions exactly.*
 
Interviews can be conducted with the whole team or as a pair (one interviewer and one recorder). More on this in the [18F method card on interviews](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/).
 
All team members recording or conducting interviews must be familiar with research ethics and, specifically, PII concerns. The team will huddle about this before the first TTS-external interview.
 
### Intro _(5 minutes)_
 
Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.
 
You don’t have to answer any question you don’t want to answer, at any time you can ask us to stop taking notes, and we can stop at any point.
 
Any questions or concerns before we begin?
 
### Warm up _(10 minutes)_
 
Interviewer explains the TIS incubation project and why we want to hear about RaaS/HaaS. 

### Questions _(25 minutes)_
 
- Why RaaS/HaaS? What led us down this road? 
  - Agency demand?
  - Internal demand?
  - USDS demand?
 
- What did we learn from the pilot?
  - Agency needs
  - Staff needs

- Challenges in operationalizing this service? 
 
- Are we still doing RaaS/HaaS today? If not, why not? And what would you do differently today? 
 
- Which statutes, regs, policies helped and hurt RaaS efforts? (eg: OPM, interagency info sharing)
  - OPM (schedule A hiring authorities, DHA, smarter IT, etc.) 
  - Individual agency policies and/or interpretation of statutes and OPM policies
 
- Any operational processes that helped or hurt efforts? (eg: security clearance process, ATO)
 
### Wrap up _(10 minutes)_
 
Any last thoughts? Anything we should have asked about but did not?
 
Who else might we talk to? Any colleagues? Anyone in particular who knows a lot about this space or has a different perspective? **try to get a name before getting off the call**
 
Thanks so much! This has been really helpful. Please feel free to reach out if you think of anything else.
