# **Research protocol: Integration Partners**

## Framing questions

What do we want to learn? *1-3 broad questions, not necessarily what we’ll ask in interviews.*

**How do acquisition services meet the demand for professional services capabilities today?**

**What would allow acquisition services to provide contractors through vendors more efficiently?**

**Is there an ability to work with these acquisition services in a mutually beneficial manner to efficiently provide quality contractors?**

## Recruitment and targeting

Reach out through personal and professional networks

**Goal: interview no less than 3 potential integration partners**

## Interview/conversation guide

*A loosely structured and general guide with topical areas and conversation prompts related to the framing questions above. The conversation itself will not follow these questions exactly.*

### Intro

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.

We are working to better understand the processes and policies that allow you to deliver professional services contractors to agency partners, as well as the challenges and limitations.  We are researching the possibility of providing a technology marketplace for agency managers to efficiently build quality teams, that could potentially integrate your service offerings, allowing us to form a mutually beneficial partnership.

You don’t have to answer any question you don’t want to answer and we can stop at any point.

Any questions or concerns before we begin?

### Warm up

Please tell us a little about your role and exposure to the our area of interest

### Questions
*more specific than framing questions, and aligned with framing questions*

* What are the most important considerations for acquiring temporary help?
* What kind of issues do acquisitions professionals face in staffing effective teams?
     * Are you aware of any statutory, regulatory, and/or policy hurdles? 
* What kinds of professions are most in-demand from agency users of professional services acquisitions?
* Do certain agencies have special policy restrictions or exemptions that help or hurt professional services acquisitions?
* What is your service pricing model?
* Would your organization potentially want to provide capabilities through a centralized marketplace focused on people?
* If so, how could we most effectively integrate?

### Wrap up

* Any last thoughts? Anything we should have asked about but did not?
* Who else might we talk to? Any colleagues? Anyone in particular who knows a lot about this space or has a different perspective? **try to get a name before getting off the call**
* Thanks so much! This has been really helpful. Please feel free to reach out if you think of anything else.
