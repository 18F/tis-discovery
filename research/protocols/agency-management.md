# **Research protocol: Agency executives**

## Framing questions

What do we want to learn? *1-3 broad questions, not necessarily what we’ll ask in interviews.*

1. **How are you building internal technology teams to meet your project needs today, and do you ever employ hybrid employee / contractor teams?**

2. **What are the biggest successes and obstacles you have had when composing and operating technology teams?  We are very interested in any scenarios where professional services are used to complement existing employees efforts.**

3. **What would you really like to see when building and managing cross functional technology teams in the future?  Can technology help you?**


## Recruitment and targeting

Reach out through personal and professional networks.  Approach a diverse agency technology leadership pool to get a clear sense of the problem, capabilities, limitations, and general agency demands in the team building/management space.

[Recruiting email template](https://github.com/18F/tis-discovery/blob/master/research/templates/recruiting-email.md#agency-executive)

**Goal: interview IT executives from no less than 10 agencies**


## Interview/conversation guide

*A loosely structured and general guide with topical areas and conversation prompts related to the framing questions above. The conversation itself will not follow these questions exactly.*

Interviews can be conducted tutti (the whole team) or as a pair (one interviewer and one recorder). More on this in the [18F method card on interviews](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/).

All team members recording or conducting interviews must be familiar with research ethics and, specifically, PII concerns. The team will huddle about this before the first TTS-external interview.


### Intro _(5 minutes)_

*Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.*

*We like to start by getting a housekeeping item out of the way. When conducting research at 18F we take a moment to ensure there is “informed consent” to conduct the interview. “Informed consent” is a fancy way of saying “make sure that participants know what they’re getting into and are okay with it.” We will take notes today but those notes will not be attributed to your name. At the conclusion of our research it’s likely that we will create a document outlining our findings, and we **may** use direct quotations from the notes today, but - again - these, if used, would not be attributed to you. We may also publish these research findings publicly using a publicly available Github repository which we’re happy to share with you. The raw notes from our conversation today will **not** be published.*

*You don’t have to answer any question you don’t want to answer, at any time you can ask us to stop taking notes, and we can stop at any point.*

*Any questions or concerns before we begin?*


### Warm up _(10 minutes)_

*Ok, now that we’re past the bureaucratic stuff, let’s get started.  We’re working to better understand the challenges agencies face when building technology teams to meet agency missions.*  We are very interested in learning how agencies, such as yours, leverage both employees and contractors to complete projects, and what you would ideally like to see in this process.

Please tell us a little about your agency role and exposure to the technology team building process


### Questions _(25 minutes)_

*more specific than framing questions, and aligned with framing questions*

1. **Current processes**
  * How do you build technology teams today to meet the agency mission?
  * What's your strategy for workforce planning? What skills do you always have on staff? What are more flexible?
  * Do you stick with scoped project work or find yourself using professional services augmentation capabilities, both?
  * How do employees work with vendors and contractors?
  * How quickly can your agency scale staffing and vendor support with project needs?
  * Can you employ hiring authorities or other non acquisition routes to onboard temporary help?

2. **Successes and limitations**
  * What is the most successful process you have found for building technology teams in your agency?
  * What are some of your biggest pain-points in the process of building and managing teams?
  * What expertise, internal processes or policies, and/or statutes/regs/memos help your efforts? Which ones hurt your efforts?

3. **Priorities and wishes**
  * How do you prioritize what kinds of staff and vendor skills you need?
  * If you could have anything you wanted to build quality technology teams more efficiently what would that be?
  * Would technology be useful to solving some of your issues?  If so, how?
  * If technology could be useful, how would a government wide shared service be positioned to best suit your needs in the future?


### Wrap up _(10 minutes)_

* Any last thoughts? Anything we should have asked about but did not?

* Who else might we talk to? Any colleagues? Anyone in particular who knows a lot about this space or has a different perspective? **try to get a name before getting off the call**

* Thanks so much! This has been really helpful. Please feel free to reach out if you think of anything else.
