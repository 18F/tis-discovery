# **Research protocol: Technology focused businesses**

## Framing questions

What do we want to learn? *1-3 broad questions, not necessarily what we’ll ask in interviews.*

1. **How do you currently supply technology services to the government today?  Do you supply contractors to the government through professional services contracting?**

2. **What are the biggest successes and obstacles you have had when supplying technology talent to the government?  We are very interested in any scenarios where contractors worked closely with federal employees through the life of a project or extended timeframe.**

3. **What would you like to see when providing technology services to the government in the future?  Can technology help you?**


## Recruitment and targeting

Reach out through personal and professional networks.  Approach a diverse pool of firms both small and other than small - as determined by the Small Business Administration’s size standards -  in an effort to better understand the challenges vendors experience in responding to Agency RFPs for technologist-based professional services, and in forming and managing technologist-centric teams to perform on contracts.

**Goal: interview no less than 10 tech focused firms across small and other than small businesses**


## Interview/conversation guide

*A loosely structured and general guide with topical areas and conversation prompts related to the framing questions above. The conversation itself will not follow these questions exactly.*

Interviews can be conducted tutti (the whole team) or as a pair (one interviewer and one recorder). More on this in the [18F method card on interviews](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/).

All team members recording or conducting interviews must be familiar with research ethics and, specifically, PII concerns. The team will huddle about this before the first TTS-external interview.


### Intro _(5 minutes)_

*Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.*

*We like to start by getting a housekeeping item out of the way. When conducting research at 18F we take a moment to ensure there is “informed consent” to conduct the interview. “Informed consent” is a fancy way of saying “make sure that participants know what they’re getting into and are okay with it.” We will take notes today but those notes will not be attributed to your name. At the conclusion of our research it’s likely that we will create a document outlining our findings, and we **may** use direct quotations from the notes today, but - again - these, if used, would not be attributed to you. We may also publish these research findings publicly using a publicly available Github repository which we’re happy to share with you. The raw notes from our conversation today will **not** be published.*

*You don’t have to answer any question you don’t want to answer, at any time you can ask us to stop taking notes, and we can stop at any point.*

*Any questions or concerns before we begin?*


### Warm up _(10 minutes)_

*Ok, now that we’re past the bureaucratic stuff, let’s get started.  We’re working to better understand the challenges vendors experience in responding to Agency RFPs for technologist-based professional services, and in forming and managing technologist-centric teams to perform on contracts.*

*Please tell us a little about your role at X company*


### Questions _(25 minutes)_

1. **Current processes**
  * How do you deploy teams to federal agencies today? 
  * How do you determine the skills and capabilities needed to deliver services? (providing people instead of project deliverables)?
  * Do you ever work with other companies in providing technology services, and if so, how? How do you configure those teams or establish ways of working between all the parties?

2. **Successes and limitations**
  * What are easiest or the most successful aspects of workforce planning with the government in providing technology services?
  * What are some of your biggest pain-points staffing projects? 
  * Are there particular challenges you face, such as policies, talent, agency processes, etc… that get in your way of providing efficient and quality service to the government?  

3. **Priorities and wishes**
  * How do you prioritize what kinds of technology service opportunities you seek to provide to the government?
  * If you could have any information to supply quality technology services more efficiently what would that be?
  * Would technology be useful to solving some of your issues?  If so, how?
  * If you had a magic wand, how would you plan your workforce and staff project teams?


### Wrap up _(10 minutes)_

* Any last thoughts? Anything we should have asked about but did not?

* Who else might we talk to? Any colleagues? Anyone in particular who knows a lot about this space or has a different perspective? **try to get a name before getting off the call**

* Thanks so much! This has been really helpful. Please feel free to reach out if you think of anything else.
