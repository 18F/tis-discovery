Interview request: challenges in forming teams of technologists

### Message

Hello {agency executive},

I’m {first researcher name} a researcher at 18F (https://www.18f.gov), part of the General Services Administration. My colleagues {second 18F staff} and {third 18f staff}, and I are working to better understand the challenges agencies face when forming project teams of federal and contractor staff. We’re specifically interested in your experience forming teams of _technologists_, and managing teams composed of both feds and contractors. Learning more about this space and your challenges will help us work to lower hurdles and improve the experience. 

**Can you, or a member of your team, spare 50 minutes over the next 2 weeks to speak with us?** To make it as easy as possible, we can conduct the interview remotely using Google Hangouts (if that works for you), or a phone call. Whichever you prefer.

We appreciate you taking the time to review our request and we hope to speak with you soon. 

Thank you,  
{first researcher name}
